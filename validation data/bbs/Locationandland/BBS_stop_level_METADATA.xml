      <abstract>The North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) (https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/) has counted birds annually for over fifty-five years. Survey 'routes' each consist of 50 'stops' (point counts) placed along a route path. Inter-stop distances and stop locations can vary from route to route and from year to year, and precise locations of each stop are not typically recorded. 
     This data set (and the associated R script) includes quantified uncertainty in BBS annual point count locations using digitized estimates of stop locations from the central United States. It also includes the necessary components to calculate the resulting land cover uncertainty for each annual point count (i.e., stop) and facilitates incorporation of this uncertainty into Bayesian multi-species hierarchical models to predict stop-level BBS bird detections. It can be used to repeat the authors' analyses, or to produce additional analyses of BBS data from other regions, for other bird species, or for other covariates.
     Files in this dataset include (1) spatial coordinates of autogenerated points placed every 40 m along BBS routes in the central United States ('Autogenerated_BBS_points.csv'), (2) the autogenerated point number nearest each digitized estimate of BBS route-stop-year combination (although the year is typically unknown; 'BBS_stops_nearest_autogen_point.csv'), (3) location uncertainty along BBS route paths of BBS stops by stop number, in terms both of autogenerated point numbers and route path distance ('BBS_stop_location_uncertainty.csv'), (4) locations and nearest autogenerated point numbers for some BBS stop locations that were recorded using GPS in known years ('WI_GPS_BBS_stops.csv'), and (5) a series of land cover habitat summary files (one for each relevant year) for BBS routes in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan that summarizes land cover within a 400 m radius of each autogenerated point on these routes (e.g., 'habSubset_nlcd_2004.csv'). Land cover classes are based on merged cover classes from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD).
     This data set can best be understood in the context of the associated R code (https://doi.org/10.5066/P1HY6LDF) and manuscript.</abstract>
      <purpose>These data were collected to quantify estimates of location and land cover uncertainty associated with stop-level bird data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) (https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/). It can be used to understand, interpret, or analyze these uncertainties. Note that these uncertainties likely vary by region and so these data will be most applicable within the region covered by the data release. Users of this data release (and associated R code: https://doi.org/10.5066/P1HY6LDF) could, for example, use our autogenerated point locations along BBS route paths in the central United States to produce their own habitat (i.e., land cover) estimates as desired. They could then use our stop location uncertainty distributions to estimate habitat uncertainty for each BBS stop and include this uncertainty in models. It is important to note that BBS estimated stop locations included in this data release are estimates based on e.g., observer notes and stop descriptions and do not represent BBS data products. The location of annual point counts, and the associations between annual counts and a given stop number, cannot be assumed to be consistent from year to year. Locations and stop numbers often vary through time, and the survey year(s) associated with most estimated stop locations in this dataset is unknown. Therefore, digitized estimates of stop locations included here should be used only to quantify variation in stop locations among routes. They cannot be assumed to be associated with BBS bird count data from a given year. They are most appropriately used in aggregate, e.g., to quantify uncertainty.</purpose>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>Autogenerated points fall directly on BBS route paths. Digitized estimates of stop locations for North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) routes are not collected by the BBS and vary in location accuracy and in currentness (i.e., applicable year). They are typically based on a third-party (i.e., other researchers) inspecting observer notes and stop descriptions, which are not always updated annually. They are therefore not paired with a known year and should not be assumed to correspond to BBS bird count data from any particular year. Rather, these estimated locations are here used only to quantify overall uncertainty and variation in stop placement, and so any errors and imprecisions should have minimal impact on our data quality. Land cover values are based on the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and so are as accurate as that source and the underlying location uncertainty allow.</attraccr>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>We obtained BBS route paths from U.S. Geological Survey (2012) and start points from the BBS dataset (Ziolkowski Jr et al. 2022). We began with all routes in our 17-state focal region (n = 1,361, then removed routes that were not conducive to our method of quantifying location uncertainty. We excluded non-random (i.e., 900-series) routes (n= 72), non-linear routes (with forks, ‘T’s, loops, or multiple GIS line segments; n = 42), route paths greater than 1000 m from their designated start points (n = 26), and routes with abnormally long (&gt;48 km; n = 79) or short (&lt;37 km; n = 5) BBS route paths. Finally, we removed routes for which digitized estimated stop locations indicated a direction of travel opposite that indicated by route start points (n = 18; 2.8% of all digitized routes). We thus retained 1,119 routes (82%). In preparation for quantifying the distributions of digitized estimated stop locations along BBS routes and extracting corresponding land cover distributions, we first used ArcGIS Pro 3.1.2 to generate sequentially numbered points every 40 m along each route. These points (hereafter ‘autogenerated points’) were numbered, e.g., 1-1000 for a 40 km route, starting at the end of the route nearest the start point. These autogenerated points therefore function as a measure of distance along a route path (hereafter ‘route distance’), such that, e.g., autogenerated point 201 on any route is (201-1) * 40 m = 8000 m from the starting end of the route path. This produced our file of autogenerated points: 'Autogenerated_BBS_points.csv'</procdesc>

        <procdesc>To quantify uncertainty in annual point count locations for each stop number (1–50) across BBS routes, we assumed that digitized estimates of stop locations were representative of the overall variation in stop locations along BBS routes in the region. We used digitized location estimates available from 13 of 17 states in our focal region in the central United States. This includes digitized estimated stop locations from Ohio (Stricker 2012, unpublished), Illinois (Thogmartin 2000, unpublished) (Thogmartin 2002), Wisconsin (Anich &amp; Striegel 2019, unpublished), parts of Missouri, Arkansas, and Oklahoma (Twedt 2020), and Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, and parts of Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana (Niemuth et al. 2017). In total, we used 25,078 estimated stop locations across 568 routes. Refer to Supplementary Material Table S1 for routes for which digitized stop location estimates were used by state, and for corresponding years and digitization methods.

Digitized estimates of stop locations for North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) routes are not collected by the BBS and vary in location accuracy and currentness (i.e., applicable year). They are typically based on a third-party (i.e., other researchers) inspecting observer notes and stop descriptions, which are not always updated on an annual basis. They are therefore not paired with a known year and should not be assumed to correspond to BBS bird count data from any particular year. They are most appropriately used in aggregate, e.g., to quantify uncertainty.

For each of these digitized estimated stop locations, we then located the nearest autogenerated point on the appropriate route. Because digitized estimates of stop locations vary in their placement along each route, the nearest autogenerated point to each stop number will also vary by route. This produced a file of the nearest autogenerated point to each stop location: 'BBS_stops_nearest_autogen_point.csv'

We extracted the distributions of autogenerated point numbers nearest each BBS stop number across the entire dataset of digitized estimated stops. This produced binned distributions (40 m bins, corresponding to spacing of autogenerated points) of distance along routes for each stop number (1–50). BBS stops beyond stop 45 were often beyond the end of 40 km route lines (e.g., on 28% of routes for stop 50), so we eliminated stops 46–50 from further analysis. We also excluded all stops for which the distance to the nearest autogenerated point was &gt;200 m (n = 457; 1.8% of all stops), which typically indicated a minor route deviation. A subset of digitized estimated stop locations (n = 837) was collected using GPS units in a known year in Wisconsin, and these were used as a validation test of our method (described in a later step).

This produced a file with the distribution of autogenerated points for each BBS stop number: 'BBS_stop_location_uncertainty_autogen_point_numbers.csv'</procdesc>

        <procdesc>To quantify land cover uncertainty at each BBS annual point count event using these estimated stop location uncertainty distributions, we first defined our land cover covariates of interest. We used NLCD layers (Dewitz 2021) for the year closest to each BBS bird survey year and merged some NLCD categories to simplify land cover classes for our analyses (described below). For modeling, we chose to focus on three broad land cover categories – forest, grass/hay, and development – to assess their effects on bird occurrences. We defined our radius of interest as 400 m, which minimizes overlap between adjacent stops, corresponds to the BBS protocol maximum aural detection distance, and is consistent with other studies examining local-scale habitat effects on birds. We then calculated proportion cover (proportion of 30-m NLCD cells of that cover class) within a 400-m radius for each of our merged land cover classes. We did this for each autogenerated point on each route for each NLCD year (2004, 2008, 2011, 2013, 2016), using the focal statistics tool in ArcGIS Pro 3.1.

We merged NLCD land cover classes as follows: 
forest: included Deciduous Forest; Evergreen Forest; Mixed Forest; Woody Wetlands
grasshay: included Grassland/Herbaceous; Pasture/Hay; Sedge/Herbaceous
devAll: included Developed, Open Space; Developed, Low Intensity; Developed, Medium Intensity; Developed, High Intensity
crops: included Cultivated Crops
wet: included 	Emergent Herbaceous Wetlands
shrub: included Shrub/Scrub

This produced a summary of land cover within a 400 m radius for each year that we include (2004, 2008, 2011, 2013, 2016): i.e., 'habSubset_nlcd_2004.csv', with one file for each included land cover (i.e., NLCD) year.</procdesc>

        <enttypd>Comma Separated Value (CSV) file containing data. This file summarizes land cover across BBS routes in the central United States by counting pixels of certain merged land cover classes based on the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). It presents pixel counts within a 400 m radius of points generated every 40 m along BBS routes. Uses the NLCD from the year indicated in the 'year' column and file name. Cover classes are merged as detailed in the 'class_merge' column metadata. When paired with the 'BBS_stop_location_uncertainty.csv' file, this file can be used to generate land cover uncertainty distributions for BBS stops. Includes all routes from our modeled region (Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan) that were conducive to our method and had digitized estimated stop locations available.</enttypd>
